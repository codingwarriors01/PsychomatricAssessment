                                Companies use decision trees for customer retention through analyzing their behaviors and releasing new offers or products to suit those behaviors. By using decision tree models, companies can figure out the satisfaction levels of their customers as well.

                                Decision trees can help physicians and medical professionals in identifying patients that are at a higher risk of developing serious ( or preventable) conditions such as diabetes or dementia.<br/> The ability of decision trees to narrow down possibilities according to specific variables is quite helpful in such cases.
